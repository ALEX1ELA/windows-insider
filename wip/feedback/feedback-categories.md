# Understand feedback categories and diagnostics

We know there's a lot of categories, which can be confusing, but if you file things in the wrong category, we might not be able to do anything with it if we get the wrong diagnostics. Use this page to check if your feedback goes into the category and subcategory you think it does and make sure you're attaching the information we need to investigate.

## Choose a category and subcategory

When you look through the list of categories and subcategories, some likely seem straight-forward, like the Microsoft Store category for feedback on the store experience. But this guidecan help you choose between some of the others.

### Apps

Use the apps category for issues opening or any issues ou experience inside apps on your device. The subcategory should be the app's name, or if we don't have a subcategory for that app, which is common for many third-party apps, choose All other apps from the bottom of the list.

### Gaming and Xbox

Issues you experience while gaming or using Xbox features on Windows should be sent here, including Game Bar, using controllers, game crashes and performance, issues using your Xbox account, or recording. If your issue doesn't fit neatly into its subcategories, use All other issues at the top of the list.

### Accessibility

Accessibility doesn't mean just anything you can't access. Rather it means features we've built specifically to help users make the most of their device, especially users with special needs, like Narrator, Magnifier, eye control, or live captions. If your feedback isn't for one of these features listed or a setting in the **Settings** > **Accessibility** section, it probably needs to be sent directly to the feature's category instead. Still be sure to tell us that it's an accessibility issue in your feedback description though.

### Customer programs

This is where feedback on the Windows Insider Program's content or forums should be sent. 

### Desktop environment

Desktop environment is one of our most important categories. It includes many parts of Windows, like the Start menu and the taskbar. Some tips to avoid confusion when filing in this category:

#### (Virtual) desktops

Use this only for your multiple desktops that you can switch between in task view. Issues for your desktop icons should go the Desktop icons subcategory, issues for your background and wallpaper should go to the Background and wallpaper subcategory, issues for windows on your desktop should go to the DWM (Desktop Window Manager) subcategory, and issues with the desktop right-click context menu should go to the Right-click context menu subcategory.

#### Clock and calendar flyout

Use this only for the taskbar date and time and calendar that opens when you select it. Feedback for the calendar app should go to **Apps** > **Calendar** instead, and issues with your settings should go to **Settings** > **Date and Time Settings** instead.

#### Desktop icons

Use this only for desktop icon issues. Issues for your multiple desktops that you can switch between in task view, should go to the (Virtual) desktops subcategory, issues for your background and wallpaper should go to the Background and wallpaper subcategory, issues for windows on your desktop should go to the DWM (Desktop Window Manager) subcategory, and issues with the desktop right-click context menu should go to the Right-click context menu subcategory.

#### DWM (Desktop Window Management)

Use this for issues with using app windows on your desktop, like issues with them going behind things, their freame, or the close, maximize, and minimize buttons on your app window.

#### Lock screen

Use this for the screen you see when you log in to your device with the time and some settings options. If you're having problems with the Spotlight image backgrounds here though, please use the Windows Spotlight subcategory instead.

#### MTC controls and audio

Use this only for the media controls and audio controls you see in the Quick Settings or using your hardware keys for volume and brightness. If your volume, audio, or microphones simply aren't working, send that feedback to **Devices and drivers** > **Audio and sound** instead. 

#### Start menu

Use this only for the Start menu, not for the taskbar, other things like apps not starting, or your device not starting up correctly.

#### System tray 

Use this only for the right side of the taskbar with your date and time, small system icons, and the show hidden icons flyout.

#### Taskbar

Use this only for the taskbar outside of the right side with your date and time, small system icons and the show hidden icons flyout which has its own subcategory called System tray. Task manager and Start menu also shouldn't go here, they have their own subcategories.

#### All other issues

Use this if you're experiencing explorer crashes, issues with small system dialogs that pop up as you do things like run programs, or other major issues on Windows that you're not sure where to put.

### Devices and Drivers

If something is wrong with your device and its hardware, like audio or sound, or connecting to other devices, like Bluetooth, USB keyboards, printers, or scanners, use this category.

### Display and graphics

If something is wrong with your display, like using multiple displays, brightness, night light, scaling, or resolutions, use this category.

### Files, folders, and online storage

Use this for any issues with File Explorer, OneDrive, your storage settings, or disk space, use this category.

### Input and language

Use this category for all things input, including things like your mouse or pen not working, the emoji panel, keyboard and language switching, or your keyboard not working to type or hardware keys not working, which should go to the Text input subcategory.

### Install and update

Use this category for all issues with updates, like issues installing an update, backup and restore, or loss of settings after an update.

### Network and internet

Use this category for all issues around your internet and network connectivity, like VPNs, connecting to wi-fi, ethernet, or cellular, and the network troubleshooter.

### Power and battery

Use this category for all issues with your power, like powering on or off or sleep, or with your battery, like battery saver, overheating, or app energy consumption.

### Recovery and uninstall

Use this category for issues with things like reset this PC, image backups, and USB recovery drives.

### Security and privacy

Use this category for all things security, like BitLocker, encryption, Microsoft Defender, logging into your device or Windows Hello, or issues with your account.

### Settings

Use this category for any issues with your settings, like personalization, date and time, sound, and Windows update.

## Include the diagnostics needed to investigate

In certain categories and subcategories, we need certain diagnostics attached with your report to be able to take action.
