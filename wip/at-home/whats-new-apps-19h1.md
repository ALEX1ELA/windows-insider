# Windows app updates 
You will find information on the latest major app updates for Windows 10 released to Windows Insiders here. Currently, app updates are sorted by date in which announcements of the app updates are made. In the future, we will be planning to include more details such as version numbers of the apps. 

**Note**: *Not all app updates will be listed here. Only app updates that include major changes e.g. new features, etc. will be noted here.*

## Your Phone 
These updates are currently available using PCs running Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds (19H1). For more information on setting up and running the app, see [Your Phone app help](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4459358/windows-10-your-phone-app-help).

__**4/26/2019__

__Never miss your Android phone’s notifications__ 

Today, we are excited to provide a preview into the newest feature for the Your Phone app – __Notifications__.
Stop reaching for your phone to check your notifications. Boost your focus and productivity by seeing your phone’s notifications on your PC. You are in control and manage which apps you want to receive notifications from. Dismiss a notification on one device and it goes away on the other.

![Your Phone](images/18885-apps-1.png "phone screen")
 
With this preview, you can:
* See incoming phone notifications in real-time
* View all of your phone notifications in one place
* Customize which notifications you want to receive
* Clear notifications individually or all at once

This feature will gradually roll out to Insiders on 19H1 builds. It may take a few days for this feature to show up inside the Your Phone app.

We look forward to your feedback as we continue to test, learn, and improve the overall experience.

__Notifications Requirements__ 
* Android devices version 7.0 and greater with at least 1GB of RAM.
* Not supported on devices that have Notification Access disabled by work or other policy.

__Phone screen now supports additional Android devices__

As promised, we have expanded [phone screen support](http://aka.ms/wip18356) to additional phone models – __OnePlus 6, OnePlus 6T, Samsung Galaxy S10e, S10, S10+, Note 8, Note 9__. Try out phone screen and send us your feedback. We will continue to expand the list of supported devices over time.

**3/12/2019 - Version 1.0.20701.0**
 
__Take your phone’s screen to the big screen__  

We are excited to provide an early preview into the newest feature for the Your Phone app – phone screen. You can now mirror your Android phone’s screen directly on your PC without having to dig for your phone.

![Your Phone](images/18335-1.png "phone screen")

The new phone screen feature gives you easy access to your phone apps on your PC. Whether scheduling a ride to the airport or checking your social updates, do it with ease from the comfort of your PC without having to take your phone out of your bag or go back and forth between devices. Go ahead, give your thumbs a break, and get things done faster with your keyboard and mouse.

![Your Phone](images/18335-2.png "phone screen2")

This feature will gradually roll out to Insiders on 19H1 builds. It may take a few days for this feature to show up inside the Your Phone app (version 1.0.20701.0 and above).
You can use the Your Phone app on any Windows 10 PC running Windows builds 1803 (RS4) or newer and any Android phone running Android version 7.0 or newer. But the new phone screen feature is initially only compatible with a limited set of devices. Surface Go will be the first device in the Surface lineup to preview this feature. We will continue to expand the list of devices over time for both the PC and phone.
We look forward to your feedback as we continue to test, learn, and improve the overall experience.

**Phone screen requirements:**
* Select Android phones* running Android 7.0 or greater (*Samsung Galaxy S8/S8+/S9/S9+).
* Windows 10 PC with a Bluetooth radio that supports low energy peripheral role. [How to check if your PC supports this](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2066643).
* Latest 19H1 preview build (18342+ recommended).
* Android phone must be on, within Bluetooth range of the PC, and connected to the same network as the PC.

## Snip & Sketch 

**3/6/2019 - Version 10.1901.10521.0**

We’re in the process of rolling out out a new app update to Snip & Sketch. It includes a number of fixes based on your feedback, among which are:
* We fixed an issue that could result in snips being a bit blurry after saving or copying to clipboard.
* We fixed an issue where copying to clipboard would fail if you switched out of the app while the copy operation was in progress.
* We fixed an issue where the suggested file name was unexpectedly a GUID for snips opened from Win + Shift + S toast.
* We’ve added Narrator (screen reader) confirmations when a snip is copied to clipboard.
* We’ve updated the default save format to be png. You can still use the dropdown when saving to pick your desired format if it’s not png.
* We fixed an issue where auto-copy changes to clipboard wasn’t working on return from Snip & Sketch settings.
* We fixed an issue where the app might crash if you closed two app windows one after another.
* We fixed an issue where the default save file location was documents rather than pictures. In fixing this we also fixed an issue where when saving the save dialog wouldn’t remember where you last saved a snip.

The rollout of this app is not tied to the upgrade, so you may see it outside the bounds of this flight.

**12/10/2018 - Version 10.1811.3371.0**

__Bring window snip to your modern snipping experience.__ Start your snip via your preferred entry point (WIN + Shift + S, Print Screen (if you’ve enabled it), directly from within Snip & Sketch, etc.), and select the window snip option at the top, and snip away! That selection will be remembered the next time you start a snip.

![Windows Snip](images/snip_window.png "windows snip")


**10/31/2018 - Version 10.1809.2964.0**

This update brings several improvements, including:
- **Adding some emphasis.** Planning to paste your screenshot somewhere? Does that place have the same color background as the background of your screenshot? When you update to the latest app version you’ll find a new option to add a border to your screenshots – giving them that little bit extra needed to stand out.
- **Printing!** Sometimes you want to keep a physical copy of your screenshots – we hear you that it took too many steps before, and have added a button in the toolbar so you can print directly from the app. (You can also print to PDF!)  
![Printing](images/18272-app1.jpg "The Print option in Snip & Sketch")

- **Refining our save options:**
   - If you have unsaved changes and go to close a window or open a file that will now pop a confirmation.
   - The default proposed file name will now include a timestamp.
   - Saving now also supports .jpg and .gif file types.
   - New settings page! We’re replacing the old **About** flyout with a full settings page where you’ll find the aforementioned option to add a border, an option for updates made to your snip to copy automatically to your clipboard, and more.
   ![New Settings page](images/18272-app2.png "The Settings page in Snip & Sketch")


**9/6/2018 - Version 10.1807.2286.0**

We flighted version 10.1807.2286.0 of **Snip & Sketch** (née Screen Sketch), which included the highly requested delay snip feature. There was a bug in Build 18219 blocking the New button from working, so please try it out once you upgrade! 

Just click the chevron next to the New button in the app and you’ll now find options to **Snip now**, **Snip in 3 seconds**, and **Snip in 10 seconds**. If you have the app open or pinned to your taskbar, you can also just right click the icon in the taskbar to get these options, since we’ve added them to the jump list – let us know what you’d like to see next!

## Mail & Calendar 

**2/1/2019 - Version 16.0.11231.20082**

Currently rolling out to Insiders in Fast, this app update brings:

__Dark mode now extended to Mail and Calendar items:__ Building on our previous release of Dark mode in Mail and Calendar, we have extended our dark UI to more parts of our app. With this update, Dark mode now works when composing a new message, updating a calendar item or reading your email. This helps provide a calmer reading experience for people that work in a low light environment or just prefer screens that are less bright, and helps to reduce eye strain.
To turn on Dark mode, go to settings, select “Personalization”, and choose “Dark mode”. For those who already have Dark mode enabled, you will see it expand to cover your email reading and compose experiences after receiving the update.
If you prefer to view a particular email in light mode, look for the sunshine icon in the command bar to “turn on the lights” and view the email with a white background. This can help if a particular email is not formatted well for Dark mode.

![Dark mode](images/18329-5.jpg "Dark mode now extended to Mail and Calendar items")

__Default Font:__ We are introducing a top customer requested feature: Default font. Now you can customize how new messages will look. If you create a new mail or reply to an existing mail, the text you type will be in the font face, size, color and emphasis you have selected.  To change your default font, go into settings and select “Default font”. Default font applies per-account and does not roam to other devices. These updates are the latest in a [series of updates](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-s-new-in-mail-and-calendar-for-windows-10-9822b33c-b9ad-48bc-ac53-c1b6136e405b?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) we’ve made based on your feedback, and we’re looking forward to hearing what you’d like to see improved next!
