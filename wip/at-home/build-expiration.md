# Updating from an expiring Insider Preview build
To move off the Insider Preview build expiring on your device, you can either get preview builds in the Dev Channel, reinstall Windows using a Windows Insider ISO to move to the Beta channel, or start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10.

## Get Insider Preview Builds in the Dev Channel

1. Go to [**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program**](http://aka.ms/WIPSettings) on your device.

2. Set it to the Dev Channel.

3. Go to [**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate) to check for the latest update, and update your device to the latest build available in the Dev Channel.


## Reinstall Windows with a Windows Insider Beta Channel ISO

1. Back up all your files and applications. A clean install with a Windows Insider ISO will erase all of your files, settings, and applications.

2. [Download the latest Beta Channel ISO from the Windows Insider ISO page](https://aka.ms/WIPISO) by saving it to a location on your PC or creating a bootable USB.

3. Open File Explorer and go to where you saved the ISO. Select the ISO file to open it, which lets Windows mount the image so you can access it.

4. Select the Setup.exe file to launch the install process. 

5. During setup, select the **Change what to keep** option, and then choose **Nothing** on the next screen to complete a clean intall.

6. Once it's finished installing, go to [**Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program**](http://aka.ms/WIPSettings) to set up Insider Preview builds in the Beta Channel. [Get more help setting up Insider Preview builds.](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started#flight)
