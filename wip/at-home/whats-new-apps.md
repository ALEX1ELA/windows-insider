# Windows app updates
You will find information on the latest major app updates for Windows 10 released to Windows Insiders here. Currently, app updates are sorted by date in which announcements of the app updates are made. In the future, we will be planning to include more details such as version numbers of the apps. 

**Note**: *Not all app updates will be listed here. Only app updates that include major changes e.g. new features, etc. will be noted here.*

## Your Phone app 
**9/17/2018**<br/>
**Text from your PC – stay connected with Your Phone app**: Your Phone app is live for Insiders. You must link your Android phone to your computer through **Your Phone** app. You will receive an app from Microsoft, which you must download to your mobile phone and follow the setup prompts. Android 7.0+ devices are compatible with **Your Phone** app. For PCs tied to the China region, **Your Phone** app services will be enabled in the future.


We are still fine tuning the app, so if you are looking for support, check out workarounds in the [FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4459358/windows-10-your-phone-app-help).


For iPhone users, **Your Phone** app helps you to link your phone to your PC. Surf the web on your phone, then send the webpage instantly to your computer to pick up where you left off to continue what you’re doing–read, watch, or browse with all the benefits of a bigger screen. With a linked phone, continuing on your PC is one share away.

**Your Phone** app gives you instant access to your most recent photos and texts from your Android phone. [Snap a pic](https://aka.ms/gul-dukat) on your Android, see it on your PC. It’s just easier. Text your friends, group message, and type with a keyboard. Your Phone app allows you to view, send, and receive the SMS from your Android, on your computer.

There are a few ways you can text from your PC. We mentioned the ability to type with a keyboard, the obvious. But how about inking a reply? On pen-capable devices, use your digital pen to focus near the text field in Your Phone app’s messages. Ink a message and watch your fresh ink convert to text and send. Or try using just your voice to dictate a message (US English only at this time). Press the Windows logo key + H to start dictation. On a touch keyboard, select the microphone button. Use dictation to make your text entry easier.

You can also now [text from your PC](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/09/07/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17755/). Try out these features and let [@VishnuNath](https://twitter.com/VishnuNath) know what you think. We can’t wait to hear from you. Love it, like it, or have feedback in any form – share it! Have you pinned Your Phone app to your taskbar yet? We are still fine tuning the app, so if you are looking for support, check out workarounds in [Your Phone app FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=870178).


## Your Phone companion app 
**9/12/2018**<br/>
Microsoft Apps on Android is now called **Your Phone companion** app.


**Your Phone** app on your PC now links you to **Your Phone companion** app on your Android phone.  If you’ve previously installed Microsoft Apps on your Android phone, when the app auto-updates, you’ll see a fresh set of screens that maintain the mobile app’s visual connection to **Your Phone** app on PC. 

Tap or click on **Top Microsoft Apps** to get 20 quick recommendations. Or click on the left menu button, and browse through mobile apps from Microsoft, organized by app categories.

## Snip & Sketch 
**9/6/2018**<br/>
We flighted version 10.1807.2286.0 of **Snip & Sketch** (née Screen Sketch), which included the highly requested delay snip feature. There was a bug in Build 18219 blocking the New button from working, so please try it out once you upgrade! 

Just click the chevron next to the New button in the app and you’ll now find options to **Snip now**, **Snip in 3 seconds**, and **Snip in 10 seconds**. If you have the app open or pinned to your taskbar, you can also just right click the icon in the taskbar to get these options, since we’ve added them to the jump list – let us know what you’d like to see next!

## Microsoft To-Do 
**9/6/2018**<br/>
We added support for handwritten input to allow you to capture your tasks seamlessly in Microsoft To-Do (Version 1.39.1808.31001 and higher).
Please try it out and let us know what you think by tweeting at [@MicrosoftToDo](https://twitter.com/MicrosoftToDo) on Twitter. With Ink you now can:
1. Capture your tasks naturally by writing directly on the list’s surface.
2. Complete your tasks by striking through them.
3. Use check-marks within the circle to the left of a task to complete it.
