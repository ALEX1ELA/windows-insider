#  What's new in the Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds
The [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/)
<b>Sets improvements</b>
What belongs together stays together – we designed Sets to help you keep webpages, documents, files, and apps connected. We’ve been hard at work since our first wave of Sets improvements. Here are the new features:
<b>Drag and drop app tabs within and between Sets windows is now supported</b>: It works just like it sounds! You can now drag an app tab around within the Set or combine tabbed app windows into Sets.
<i>Note: If you open a Microsoft Edge tab outside of a Set, you can’t drag and drop it into a Sets window. Drag and drop for Microsoft Edge web tabs within Sets isn’t supported yet and you may experience a crash if this is attempted.</i>

<b>Tabs are now bubbled up in Alt + Tab</b>: Have Photos, Microsoft Edge, and OneNote tabbed together? You can now use Alt + Tab to switch between them. Prefer to only show the primary window in Alt + Tab? There’s a new setting – more on that in just a moment…

<i>Note: If you have multiple Microsoft Edge windows in a Set, only the one most recently accessed will be visible in Alt + Tab.</i>

<b>Improved Settings for Sets</b>: We’ve updated the Settings for Sets via Settings > System > Multitasking. To start with, Sets now has its own section on this page, and is searchable (try typing “Sets” or “tabs” and it will appear in the dropdown). We’ve also added a setting to control the Alt + Tab behavior mentioned above.

<b>File Explorer & Sets Improvements</b>: We’ve heard your feedback – you’d like it to be easier to get two File Explorer windows grouped together, and we’re working on it. To start with, you no longer need to hold CTRL on the new tab page to launch a File Explorer window in a tab (this was a temporary necessity with the last wave). We’ve also added a new keyboard shortcut to open a new tab when a File Explorer window is in focus: Ctrl + T. Remember, you can use Ctrl + N to open a new window, and Ctrl + W to close the window/tab.

Finally, we’ve added some new UI for easily opening new tabs and windows in the File Menu.

And also, in the context menu when right-clicking on a folder.

<b>New context menu options for tabs in Sets</b>: If you right-click on a Sets tab, you’ll discover we’ve added several options for you to leverage, including “close other tabs”, “move to new window”, and “close tabs to the right”.
