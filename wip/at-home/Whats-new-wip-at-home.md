# What's new in the Windows 10 Insider preview builds (19H1)
The [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/) lets you preview builds of the upcoming release of Windows 10. This topic lists all new Windows 10 features for you to try. 


## Evolving Focus assist (Build 18277)
[Starting with the Windows 10 April 2018 Update](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/05/09/windows-10-tip-how-to-enable-focus-assist-in-the-windows-10-april-2018-update/), we embarked on a journey to help reduce the number of distractions you encounter when you’re trying to get in the zone. With today’s build, we’re taking this to the next level: We’ve added a new focus assist option so that when you’re doing *anything* full screen we can automatically turn on focus assist.

![Focus assist updates](images/18277-image1.png "A screenshot of the Focus assist updates")

Watching a movie? Poring over some excel tables? Studying? Focus assist is here for you, and will keep your notifications quiet until you exit full screen mode.

Like our other focus assist settings, this can be found under Settings > System > Focus Assist. Make sure you take a moment to customize your priority list to ensure any notifications you want to break through the rule will appear! If you’d like to turn off the warning notification that’s shown in Action Center after entering focus assist, you can do so by clicking the rule in Focus Assist Settings which prompted the notification.

## Improving your Action Center experience (Build 18277)
One of the top requests we’ve heard from you is that you’d prefer the brightness Quick action to be a slider instead of a button, and with today’s build we’re making it happen!

![Action Center](images/18277-image2.png "Action Center slider")

But wait, there’s more!

You can now easily customize your Quick actions right from the Action Center itself, rather than having to go into Settings. That means not only can you re-arrange in the moment, but you can also add any Quick action you need on the fly, without needing for it to always take up space.

![Custom Quick actions](images/18277-image3.gif "Screenshot that shows the updated Settings panel")

We’d love for you to try it out and share feedback!

## Preparing for Emoji 12 (Build 18277) 
With today’s build, Insiders will get a first look at the emoji we’ve designed so far in preparation for the Emoji 12 release! These emoji are available for use via the emoji panel (WIN + .) and the touch keyboard.

![Emoji 12](images/18277-image4.png "Shows the new emojis")

>[!NOTE] 
>The complete list of emoji for the Emoji 12 release is [still in beta](http://blog.unicode.org/2018/10/draft-candidates-for-emoji-120-beta.html), so Insiders may notice a few changes over the coming flights as the emoji are finalized. We have a bit more work to do, including adding search keywords for the new emoji, and adding a few emoji that aren’t finished yet.

## High DPI improvements (Build 18277)
As many of you know, we’ve been working [over the past few years](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/24/high-dpi-scaling-improvements-for-desktop-applications-and-mixed-mode-dpi-scaling-in-the-windows-10-anniversary-update/#BhoQFcZJ0KWWFqub.97) to improve the High DPI story for Win32 (desktop) apps on Windows. As part of this, some of you may recall getting a toast about fixing your apps that led you to this setting we added with [Build 17063](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/#ffbtP8jT9IuKq8sp.97):

![Scaling settings](images/18277-image5.png)

In 19H1, we’re enabling this setting by default, to help automatically address some of your scaling feedback, and reduce the number of times you see that “Fix blurry apps” notification.
We’d love your feedback! Notice that some of your apps seem blurry after docking/undocking, or other mixed DPI scenarios? You can let us know by reporting it at [https://aka.ms/scalingfeedback](https://aka.ms/scalingfeedback)!

If you’re interested to learn whether or not an app is DPI aware you can find out using [this feature](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/17/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18262/) we rolled out to Task Manager a few flights ago.

## Refreshing the Japanese IME (Build 18277)
We’ve already made [a few](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/24/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18267/#3joUFcLxg0ozUFbp.97) [announcements](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/31/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18272/#FZRyBpZfJrussGPF.97) about how we plan to improve your typing experiences in Windows with this release, and we’re excited to add one more to the list today! To provide increased security and reliability, we’re updating the Japanese IME by redesigning how it works with applications. Not only that, but we’ve updated the IME candidate window interface to be cleaner and more polished:

![Japanese IME](images/18277-image7.png "Shows the Japanese IME")

You’ll notice that each text prediction candidate now has an index so you can quickly select it, just like the conversion candidates! We’re looking forward to you trying it out, and that’s not all! As part of this work, all of your familiar Japanese IME settings have now been fully integrated into Settings. If you’d like to check them out, fastest way there is to right-click the IME mode indicator in the taskbar and select Settings, although you can also get there from the Language Settings page.

![Language settings page](images/18277-image8.png "Shows the updated Language settings page")

Some Insiders have had this change for [a few flights now](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/09/18/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-18242), so we wanted to take a moment to say thank you for all of your great feedback so far! Please don’t hesitate to [continue sharing thoughts with us](https://aka.ms/inputfeedback) about typing in Windows – our ears are open and we’d love to hear from you.


## Help us shape the future of Cortana + Amazon Alexa (Build 18277)
Recently, we announced an exciting preview in the US that allows you to call up Cortana on Amazon Alexa Echo devices – and Alexa on your Windows 10 PC. You can, for example, enlist Cortana through an Amazon Alexa Echo device to tell you your next meeting or have Alexa order groceries through your Windows 10 PC. Now, we’d like to take the experience even further with the help of Windows Insiders like you. Just start by completing this [short survey](http://aka.ms/CortanaAlexasurvey).

If you haven’t already tried it out, simply click the microphone icon in Windows Search on your Windows 10 PC and say ‘’Hey Cortana, open Alexa’. Or, on your Amazon Echo device, say “Alexa, open Cortana” on Echo devices. (Then let us know what you think in the Feedback Hub.) For more, see our [AI blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/alexa-cortana-public-preview/.

## Sign-in options redesigned for Windows Hello (Build 18272)

Security shouldn’t be intimidating, and we aspire to help you eliminate passwords. That’s why we want to make sure you can easily set up your first line of defense securing your device with Windows Hello. Your feedback that the previous design was cluttered, and confusing is what drove us to simplify the Sign-in options Settings. We believe this update will help you choose the safest and fastest sign-in option for your needs, whether that’s using a PIN or a biometric factor like fingerprint or facial recognition.

Ultimately, we want to help you make the right decision for your situation. By condensing each sign-in option into a list that explains individual properties and next step for setup, we hope you feel more informed the next time you decide how you want to sign in using enhanced security features with Windows Hello.

![Redesigned sign-in options](images/18272-image1.png)

## Input improvements (Build 18272)

**Expanding SwiftKey’s typing intelligence to more languages:** In RS5 we started working on bringing [SwiftKey’s AI technology to Windows](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/06/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17692/#KqkzsMxQJAWrMbJC.97), and we’re excited to announce that we’re expanding support to the following languages:

- English (Canada) – en-CA
- English (India) – en-IN
- French (Canada) – fr-CA
- French (Belgium) – fr-BE
- French (Switzerland) – fr-CH
- Portuguese (Portugal) – pt-PT
- German (Switzerland) – de-CH
- Spanish (United States) – es-US

If you’re a touch keyboard user that writes in any of these languages, please try out the text predictions and shapewriting in this build and [let us know](http://aka.ms/inputfeedback) how it feels for you. If you’d like to compare how the keyboard feels with and without this change, check the options for supported languages under **Settings > Devices > Typing > Suggestions and Autocorrections**.

Using a physical keyboard? Hardware keyboard text suggestions are also supported with the above languages now. Text suggestions for the hardware keyboard is a learning tool we originally introduced in [RS4](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/11/08/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17035-pc/), and expanded language support for [with RS5](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/10/03/windows-10-accessibility-in-the-october-2018-update/). If you’d like to try it out in one of the supported languages, you can do so by enabling the **Show text suggestions as I type** feature under **Settings > Devices > Typing**.

![Text suggestions](images/18272-image2.gif)

**Indic Phonetic keyboards now available for PC:** Do you write in an Indic language? We’ve heard your feedback, and in addition to the Indic Traditional INSCRIPT keyboards already available, with today’s build we’re adding Indic Phonetic keyboards for Hindi, Bangla, Tamil, Marathi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Odia, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam!

How does a phonetic keyboard work? Basically it’s a convenient way of typing that leverages the English QWERTY keyboard – as you type, we use transliteration to suggest possible Indic text candidates. For example, if you typed "namaste" using the Hindi Phonetic keyboard we would suggest नमस्ते, as you can see in the below gif:

![image3](images/18272-image3.gif)

If your native language is one of the above languages or you have some knowledge of Indic languages, please try this out with either the hardware or touch keyboard and let us know how it feels.

Here are the steps to get started:

1. Select **Start > Settings > Time & Language-> Language** from the navigation menu.
2. Select the **+** icon labeled [Add a preferred language] (or skip ahead to step 4 if your preferred Indic language was already added).
3. Type the name of an Indic language into the search box and select it – for example "Hindi". Click **Next** and install the Indic language on your device, which will return you to the Language page.
4. Now back on the Language page, click the one you just added, and then click **Options**. This will take you to that language’s options page.
5. Select the **+** icon labeled [Add a keyboard].
6. Enable the Phonetic keyboard, for example [Hindi Phonetic – Input method editor] – now the languages options page will look something like this:
   ![image](images/18272-image4.png)

7. Click input indicator on the taskbar (or press the Windows key + Space) and select the Indic Phonetic keyboard. Time to type something!
   >[!NOTE]
   >You need to [download the dictionaries](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/features-on-demand-v2--capabilities) used for the Indic Phonetic keyboards. Right after adding the keyboard, please connect to Internet – you may need to wait a bit for the dictionary download to finish.

## Accessibility improvements (Build 18272) 

**Narrator Caps Lock ON alert while typing:** Narrator will now alert you when you are accidentally typing with Caps Lock turned on. The setting is on by default. To adjust this setting, visit Narrator Settings (Ctrl + Win + N), then navigate to the “Change how much content you hear” heading and review the combo box for “Change when you receive Caps Lock warnings while typing”.

It will work even if you have character echo option ("Hear characters as you type") disabled, and it will work in edit fields as well as password field. By default, Narrator will always alert you regardless of presses of the Shift key as you type alphabetic characters. But you can choose to only be alerted when you press the Shift key together with an alphabetic character, or you can disable the feature altogether.

In this initial release, the sound effect you hear will sound like the standard Narrator error sound effect which we are working on improving. We look forward to your feedback on this new feature!

## Input Improvements (Build 18267)
**Vietnamese Telex and Number key-based keyboards are now available on your PC**: Do you write Vietnamese? We want you to have the best possible typing experience, so we’re happy to announce that with this build you can now use Vietnamese [Telex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telex_(input_method)) and Number-key based (VNI) keyboards for typing Vietnamese! Bringing these keyboard options to PC has been one of the top feature requests in the input space, so we’re looking forward to you trying it out!

Here’s a short animation of what it looks like (using the touch keyboard so you can see what we’re typing):

![Vietnamese keyboard](images/vietnamese-touch-keyboard.png "Vietnamese keyboard support")

If your native language is Vietnamese or you have some knowledge of the Vietnamese language, please try them out with hardware keyboard or touch keyboard and let us know how it feels.  Here are the steps to get started:

1. Select **Start > Settings > Time & Language > Language** from the navigation menu.
2. Select the **+** icon labeled [Add a preferred language] (or skip to step 4 if Vietnamese was already added).
3. Type *Vietnamese* in the search box and select **Vietnamese**. Click the **Next** button and install Vietnamese on your device, which will return you to **Language** page.
4. Click **Vietnamese**, and then click the **Option button**, that will allow you to navigate to **Language options: Vietnamese**.
5. Select the **+** icon labeled [Add a keyboard] (or skip to step 7 if your target keyboard was already added).
6. Enable the Vietnamese Telex keyboard or Vietnamese Number key-based keyboard (whichever you prefer).
7. Click the input indicator button on the taskbar (or press Windows key + Space) and select Vietnamese Telex or Number-key based keyboard. Input anything via your hardware keyboard or touch keyboard.

**More symbols are now available on the touch keyboard**: Now you can easily access more symbols and special characters directly from touch keyboard. After changing to the number & symbols view (&123) on the touch keyboard, just tap the new ‘Ω ‘ key and you’ll now see a number of tabs with lists of symbols.

![more touch keyboard symbols](images/touch-keyboard.png "more touch keyboard symbols")


## Accessibility Improvements (Build 18267)
* **Narrator works better with Chrome now!** Using up and down arrows in scan mode, navigating with tab key, continuous reading commands, and navigating by headings and links have initial support for Chrome, with more functionality coming in future flights.
* **Narrator Braille**: BRLTTY version 5.6 is now provided which adds USB support for Inceptor and Orbit 20 displays. In addition, the BrailleNote Touch is recognized when using USB. Baum displays can now use B9 and B10 interchangeably. Liblouis binaries and tables have been updated to version 3.7.0.
* **UI Automation framework IAccessible2 Support**: The UI Automation framework now supports translating IAccessible2 information from Chrome, which supports IAccessible2 rather than UI Automation. This enables UI Automation clients to receive the IAccessible2 information through the UI Automation client interfaces.

## Enhanced Mode for Search Indexer (Build 18267)
To improve our search indexing, we created a new feature that enables Windows to search all your folders and drives, instead of limiting search to your documents, pictures, videos, and desktop by default. To turn it on, search for *Windows search settings*, and in the Searching Windows settings, under “Find My Files”, select **Enhanced** to begin the one-time indexing process. It will take about 15 minutes for search to begin returning these additional files in results. If you have lots of files, it may take longer. Make sure you plug in before you start, indexing is a resource-intensive activity.

When the indexing is complete, you’ll be able to find all your files almost instantly when you use Windows Search. To exclude a folder from search, add it to the Excluded Folders list. Thanks for your feedback about search and the indexer. These improvements were made because of your input. Keep the feedback coming!

![search indexer](images/search-index.png "search indexer")

## DPI Awareness in Task Manager (Build 18262)
We added a new optional column to the **Details** tab of **Task Manager** so you can look at DPI awareness per process as in the following example:

![Showing the DPI Awareness category in Task Manager, with examples of Per-Monitor and System ](images/dpi-aware-task-manager.png "Showing the DPI Awareness category in Task Manager, with examples of Per-Monitor and System ")

To show the column, right-click on any of the column headers in the **Details** tab, click **Select Columns**, then add **DPI Awareness** to the list. To learn more about DPI Awareness, see [High DPI Desktop Application Development on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/hidpi/high-dpi-desktop-application-development-on-windows).

## Uninstall additional inbox apps (Build 18262)
In 19H1, we are adding the ability to uninstall the following (preinstalled) Windows 10 inbox apps via the context menu on the **Start** menu **All Apps** list:
* 3D Viewer (previously called Mixed Reality Viewer)
* Calculator
* Calendar
* Groove Music
* Mail
* Movies & TV
* Paint 3D
* Snip & Sketch
* Sticky Notes
* Voice Recorder

In the Windows 10 October 2018 Update and prior, only the following inbox apps could be uninstalled via the context menu on the **Start** menu **All Apps** list: 
* Microsoft Solitaire Collection
* My Office
* OneNote
* Print 3D
* Skype
* Tips
* Weather

## Narrator Improvements (18262)
**Narrator Read by Sentence**: You can now read next, current and previous sentences in Narrator. Read by sentence is available with the keyboard and with touch. Move by sentence doesn’t yet work for Braille. 
* Caps + Ctrl + Period (.) to Read next sentence
* Caps + Ctrl + Comma (,) to Read current sentence
* Caps + Ctrl + M to Read previous sentence 
Sentence is now a new Narrator view and can be reached via Caps + Page Up or Caps + Page Down and then you can navigate with Caps + Left arrow for move by previous sentence and Caps + Right arrow for move by next sentence. 

## Enhanced settings for Ethernet (Build 18252)
You can now use the **Settings** app to configure advanced Ethernet IP settings. We have added support for configuring a static IP address as well as setting a preferred DNS server. These settings were previously accessed within **Control Panel**, but you will now find them on the connection properties page under **IP settings**.

![Showing the enhanced ethernet settings](images/enhanced-ethernet-settings.png "Showing the enhanced ethernet settings")

## New icon for disconnected Internet (Build 18252)
First seen on Always Connected PCs, we brought the disconnected internet icon to all devices running Windows 10. This single icon appears when there is no internet connection detected, and replaces the individual disconnected icons for Cellular, Wi-Fi, and Ethernet. This new icon should help you quickly identify network problems so that you can take action to resolve them.

![Showing the new icon for disconnected internet](images/disconnected-internet-icon.png "Showing the new icon for disconnected internet")

## Ebrima font addition with ADLaM support (Build 18252)
You can now read your ADLaM documents and webpages with the Windows Ebrima font!

ADLaMis a writing system for Pular/Fulfulde, the language of the Fulani people, predominantly residing in west Africa. In the early 1990s, two young teenager brothers, Abdoulaye and Ibrahima Barry, created this writing system. Their work became “Bindi Pulaar” and eventually “ADLaM,” ADLaM is enabling literacy and growing in use for commerce, education, and publishing across western Africa. It was added to Unicode in Unicode 9.0.

The Ebrima font also supports other African writings systems N’ko, Tifinagh, Vai and Osmanya – here’s a sample of what the font looks like:

![Showing sample of the Ebrima font](images/ebrima-font.png "Showing sample of the Ebrima font")

## Bringing acrylic to the Windows sign-in screen (Build 18237)
The Windows sign-in screen now supports [acrylic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/acrylic), a type of brush from the [Fluent Design System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/fluent-design-system/index), to the sign-in screen background.  The translucent texture of this transient surface helps you focus on the sign-in task by moving the actionable controls up in the visual hierarchy while maintaining their accessibility.

![Showing acrylic in Windows sign-in screen](images/acrylic-sign-in.png "Showing sample of the Ebrima font")
