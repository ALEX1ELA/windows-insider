#  What's new in the Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds
The [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/)
<b>Sets improvements</b>
What belongs together stays together – we designed Sets to help you keep webpages, documents, files, and apps connected. We’ve been hard at work since our first wave of Sets improvements. Here are the new features:
<b>Drag and drop app tabs within and between Sets windows is now supported</b>: It works just like it sounds! You can now drag an app tab around within the Set or combine tabbed app windows into Sets.
<i>Note: If you open a Microsoft Edge tab outside of a Set, you can’t drag and drop it into a Sets window. Drag and drop for Microsoft Edge web tabs within Sets isn’t supported yet and you may experience a crash if this is attempted.</i>
