# Getting started with the Windows Insider Preview Program
There are three steps to get you set up with the Windows Insider Program for Server: register as a Windows Server Insider, install a build, and engage by providing feedback via the Feedback Hub or Windows Insiders Tech Community. The steps are outlined at [Getting started](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started/). 

If you an administrator and want to participate in the Windows Insider Program inside your network, see [Get Started with Server](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/for-business-getting-started-server/).
