## Leave the program

Windows Insiders help shape the future of Windows, and your participation is important to us. But if you're sure you'd like to stop getting emails and Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds from us, you can unregister and leave the program. 

If you'd just like to stop getting Insider Preview builds, you can also unenroll your device, but stay registered to keep getting email updates from us.

## Stop receiving Insider Preview builds

If you no longer want to receive Insider Preview builds, you'll have to unenroll your device. If you don't leave the program though, you will continue to receive emails. To unenroll your device:

1. Go to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Insider Program](https://aka.ms/WIPSettings)**, and under **Stop Insider Preview Builds**, flip the switch. 

2. Depending on which build and channel your device was in, you might have to wait for this to take effect or take further action to recover your device.

- If your device is currently running a public release of Windows, this will immediately opt you out of getting preview builds. Just restart your device to complete the process.

- If your device was on a preview build in the Beta Channel or Release Preview Channel, it will continue getting updates until the next public release is installed. Once that happens, it will opt you out of future preview builds, without any further action from you. This is to make sure your device doesn't get stuck on an unsupported version of Windows that could have security issues. Depending on where that channel's builds are in the development cycle, this could take some time.

- If your device was on a preview build in the Dev Channel, or you don't want to wait for the next public release in the Beta Channel or Release Preview Channel, you should complete a clean installation of Windows.

> [!NOTE] 
> If you're receiving Insider Preview builds through work but aren't the administrator, you will still get preview builds until your organization leaves the program or adjusts your settings. 

## Clean installation of Windows

> [!NOTE] 
> A clean installation is an advanced option to help you start fresh on your device. This will remove all your personal files, apps, and drivers, apps and customizations from your device manufacturer, and changes you made in Settings. We recommend you read through these steps and make sure you're confident how to do them before you get started.

### Create installation media

1. Back up all your files and applications. A clean install will erase all of your files, settings, and applications.

2. [Download this tool](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) and select **Run**. You need to be an administrator to run this tool.

3. If you agree to the license terms, select Accept.

4. On the **What do you want to do?** page, select **Create installation media for another PC**, and then select **Next**.

5. Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10. 

6. Select which media you want to use:

- **ISO file.** Save an ISO file to your device, which can also be used to create a DVD. After the file is downloaded, you can go to where the file was saved, or select Open DVD burner, and follow the instructions to burn the file to a DVD.

- **USB flash drive.** Attach a blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space. Any content on the flash drive will be deleted.

### Using the ISO file you created

1. Open File Explorer and go to where you saved the ISO. Select the ISO file to open it, which lets Windows mount the image so you can access it.

2. Select the setup.exe file to launch the install process.

3. During setup, select the **Change what to keep** option, and then choose **Nothing** on the next screen to complete a clean intall.

4. Once it's finished installing, you can check for updates now by going to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate)** and selecting **Check for updates**.

### Using the USB or DVD you created

1. Attach the USB flash drive or insert the DVD in the device where you want to install Windows 10.

2. Restart your device.

3. If your device does not automatically boot to the USB or DVD media, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings. 

4. On the **Install Windows** page, select your language, time, and keyboard preferences, and then select **Next**.

5. Select Install Windows.

6. Once it's finished installing, you can check for updates now by going to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate)** and selecting **Check for updates**.
