# Why join the Windows Insider Program for Business?

Microsoft recommends that all organizations have at least a few devices enrolled in the Windows Insider Program, to include the Windows Insider Program in their deployment plans, and to provide feedback on any issues they encounter to Microsoft via our Feedback Hub App. 

The Windows Insider Program for Business gives you the opportunity to:
* Get early access to Windows Insider Preview Builds. 
* Provide feedback to Microsoft in real time by using the Feedback Hub app.
* Sign in with corporate credentials (Azure Active Directory) and increase the visibility of your organization's feedback with Microsoft â€“ especially on features that support your productivity and business needs.
* Register your Azure Active Directory domain in the program, allowing you to cover all users within your organization with just one registration.
* Starting with Windows 10, version 1709, enable, disable, defer, and pause the installation of preview builds through policies.
* Track feedback provided through the Feedback Hub App across your organization.
