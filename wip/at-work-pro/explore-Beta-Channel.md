# Exploring new features in the Beta Channel

If you're an IT administrator who's interested in exploring new features as they're being created, we recommend using the Beta Channel. Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds in the Beta Channel are reliable and validated by Microsoft. Your feedback here will also have the maximum impact on helping shape the product for your business's needs. 

We recommend having a small subset of devices in the Beta Channel, usually from your IT department, or you can allow end users who are passionate about Windows to enroll themselves. 

[Set up Insider Preview builds from the Beta Channel for your organization >](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-insider/at-work-pro/wip-4-biz-manage)

Once your users are seeing new features, have them [submit feedback on behalf of your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-insider/at-work-pro/wip-4-biz-feedback), which you can then track in the Feedback Hub, to help us make improvements.
