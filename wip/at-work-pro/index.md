# Windows Insider Program for Business docs
If you are an IT Pro, incorporating the Windows Insider Program for Business into your deployment plans enables you to prepare your organization for the next update of Windows 10, to deploy new services and tools more quickly, to help secure your applications, and to increase productivity and confidence in the stability of your environment. Specifically, feature flighting (see [Windows readiness levels and flight rings](wip-4-biz-flight-levels-and-rings.md)) allows participants in the Windows Insider Program to deploy pre-production code, to test devices, and to gain early visibility into the next version of Windows. 

If you are a enterprise user, you can also join the Windows Insider for Business program. In some scenarios, you work with your IT Pro to create a domain registration that you can participate in. Either way, you are able to install new builds and provide feedback on them after you register. 

If you are interested in flighting For Windows Server 2019, we also have the Windows Server Insider Program, which you can read about in the [Windows Insider Program for Server docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-insider/at-work/).
