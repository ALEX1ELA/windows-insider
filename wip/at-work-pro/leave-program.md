# Leave the Windows Insider Program for Business

Windows Insiders help shape the future of Windows, and your participation is important to us. But if you're sure you'd like to stop getting emails and Windows 10 Insider Preview Builds from us, you can unregister and leave the program. 

If you'd just like to stop getting Insider Preview builds, you can also unenroll your device, but stay registered to keep getting email updates from us.

[If you were only using your individual device, learn more about how to stop receiving Insider Preview builds.](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-insider/at-home/leave-program)

> [!NOTE] 
> If you're receiving Insider Preview builds through work but aren't the administrator, you will still get preview builds until your organization leaves the program or adjusts your settings. 

## Stop receiving Insider Preview builds as a business

1. If you no longer want to manage Insider Preview builds for your organization using policies, you'll need to [log in to this page on our website with your registered admin account and unregister your domain](https://insider.windows.com/leave-program) with the Windows Insider Program. Unregistering also prevents other administrators from setting policies to manage Insider Preview builds across your organization.

2. After unregistering your domain, you can change update policies on a device by using the setting **Select when Preview Builds and Feature updates are received**.

3. Once you've stopped receiving Insider Preview builds on your device, you'll need to do a clean installation of Windows to reset your device.

> [!NOTE] 
> Unregistering your business domain does not remove your email from the program. You can still [run Insider Preview builds on your individual device](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-insider/at-work-pro/wip-4-biz-install). Or you can also [leave the Windows Insider Program with your email](https://insider.windows.com/leave-program).

## Clean installation of Windows

> [!NOTE] 
> A clean installation is an advanced option to help you start fresh on your device. This will remove all your personal files, apps, and drivers, apps and customizations from your device manufacturer, and changes you made in Settings. We recommend you read through these steps and make sure you're confident how to do them before you get started.

### Create installation media

1. Back up all your files and applications. A clean install will erase all of your files, settings, and applications.

2. [Download this tool](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) and select **Run**. You need to be an administrator to run this tool.

3. If you agree to the license terms, select **Accept**.

4. On the **What do you want to do?** page, select **Create installation media for another PC**, and then select **Next**.

5. Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10. 

6. Select which media you want to use:

- **ISO file.** Save an ISO file to your device, which can also be used to create a DVD. After the file is downloaded, you can go to where the file was saved, or select Open DVD burner, and follow the instructions to burn the file to a DVD.

- **USB flash drive.** Attach a blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space. Any content on the flash drive will be deleted.

### Using the ISO file you created

1. Open File Explorer and go to where you saved the ISO. Select the ISO file to open it, which lets Windows mount the image so you can access it.

2. Select the setup.exe file to launch the install process.

3. During setup, select the **Change what to keep** option, and then choose **Nothing** on the next screen to complete a clean intall.

4. Once it's finished installing, you can check for updates now by going to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate)** and selecting **Check for updates**.

### Using the USB or DVD you created

1. Attach the USB flash drive or insert the DVD in the device where you want to install Windows 10.

2. Restart your device.

3. If your device does not automatically boot to the USB or DVD media, you might have to open a boot menu or change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings. 

4. On the **Install Windows** page, select your language, time, and keyboard preferences, and then select **Next**.

5. Select Install Windows.

6. Once it's finished installing, you can check for updates now by going to **[Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update](https://aka.ms/WIPWindowsUpdate)** and selecting **Check for updates**.
