# Getting started with the Windows 10 Insider Program for Business

## Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
If you are an IT administrator in an enterprise environment, you would work with your end-users to participate in the Windows Insider Program for Business. Microsoft recommends that all enterprise devices register with a work account in Azure Active Directory (AAD). It is required to submit feedback on behalf of your organization, and for you as administrator to manage Insider Preview builds on other devices in your domain.
<b>Note:</b> Registering with your AAD account requires Windows 10 Version 1703 or later. Confirm by going to <b>Settings>System>About</b>. If you do not have an AAD account, find out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

If you want to register using a Microsoft account, see [Quick Start](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started).

## Switch between your MSA and your Corporate AAD account
You can switch between your Microsoft Account (MSA) and your organizational account by going to <b>Settings > Updates & Security > Windows Insider Program</b>. Under <b>Windows Insider account</b> select <b>Change</b>.

## Install Windows Insider Preview builds
You can install Windows 10 Insider Preview builds on individual devices, manage installation across multiple devices in an organization, or install on a virtual machine. 

### Install on an individual device
Getting set up on a single device is easy. 
1. Open Windows Insider Program settings. You can find the settings by going to <b>Start > Settings > Update & security > Windows Insider Program</b>. To see this setting, you must have administrator rights to your device.
2. Click <b>Get started</d> and follow the prompts to link your Microsoft or work account that you used to register as a Windows Insider. 

### Install across multiple devices

### Install on a virtual machine
There isn't anything special you have to do to run Windows 10 Insider Preview builds on a virtual machine. Once you have a virtual machine set up, you install just as you would on an individual device. If you need help setting up a virtual machine, see [Introduction to Hyper-V on Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/).
