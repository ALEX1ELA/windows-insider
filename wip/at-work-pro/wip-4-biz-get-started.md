# Getting started with the Windows 10 Insider Program for Business

## Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
If you are an IT administrator in an enterprise environment, you would work with your end-users to participate in the Windows Insider Program for Business. Microsoft recommends that all enterprise devices register with a work account in Azure Active Directory (AAD). It is required to submit feedback on behalf of your organization, and for you as administrator to manage Insider Preview builds on other devices in your domain.
<b>Note:</b> Registering with your AAD account requires Windows 10 Version 1703 or later. Confirm by going to <b>Settings>System>About</b>. If you do not have an AAD account, find out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

If you want to register using a Microsoft account, see [Quick Start](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started).
