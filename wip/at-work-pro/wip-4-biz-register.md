# Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
Registering for the Windows Insider Program for Business is easy and gives you access to install early builds of Windows 10. 

If you are a IT Pro, you also have the option to:
* Register your Azure Active Directory domain in the program, allowing you to cover all users within your organization with just one registration.
* Enable, disable, defer, and pause the installation of preview builds through policies (starting with Windows 10, version 1709).
* Track feedback provided through the Feedback Hub App across your organization.

As an IT Pro in an enterprise environment, you work with your end-users to participate in the Windows Insider Program for Business. Microsoft recommends that all enterprise devices register with a work account in Azure Active Directory (AAD), either individually or as part of a domain registration. It is required to submit feedback on behalf of your organization, and for you as administrator to manage Insider Preview builds on other devices in your domain.

## Use your Azure Active Directory (AAD) account
Registering with your AAD account requires Windows 10 Version 1703 or later. Confirm by going to <b>Settings>System>About</b>. If you do not have an AAD account, find out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

## Use your Microsoft account (MSA)
If you want to register using a Microsoft account and don't have one yet, see [Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/).

## Register!
Once you have an MSA or corporate AAD account, you can register on the [insider.windows.com site](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/register/). 

## Switch between accounts
You can switch between your Microsoft Account (MSA) and your organizational account (AAD) by going to <b>Settings > Updates & Security > Windows Insider Program</b>. Under <b>Windows Insider account</b> select <b>Change</b>.
