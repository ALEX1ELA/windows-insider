# Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
If you are an IT administrator in an enterprise environment, you work with your end-users to participate in the Windows Insider Program for Business. Microsoft recommends that all enterprise devices register with a work account in Azure Active Directory (AAD), either individually or as part of a domain registration. It is required to submit feedback on behalf of your organization, and for you as administrator to manage Insider Preview builds on other devices in your domain.

## Use your Azure Active Directory (AAD) account
Registering with your AAD account requires Windows 10 Version 1703 or later. Confirm by going to <b>Settings>System>About</b>. If you do not have an AAD account, find out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

## Use your Microsoft account (MSA)
If you want to register using a Microsoft account, see [Quick Start](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/getting-started).

## Register!
Once you have an MSA or corporate AAD account, you can register [here](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/register/). 

## To switch between your MSA and your Corporate AAD account?
You can switch between your Microsoft Account (MSA) and your organizational account (AAD) by going to <b>Settings > Updates & Security > Windows Insider Program</b>. Under <b>Windows Insider account</b> select <b>Change</b>.
