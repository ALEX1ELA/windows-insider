# Register for the Windows Insider Program for Business
Registering for the Windows Insider Program for Business is easy and gives you access to install early builds of Windows 10. There are two main scenarios for the Windows Insider Program for business: the IT Pro that administers a network, and the enterprise user that uses the early enterprise builds. These scenarios can work together, for instance when the IT Pro registering a domain and installing on devices in that network. Individual enterprise users may also register independently. These steps will work for both scenarios. 

As an IT Pro in an enterprise environment, you work with your team to participate in the Windows Insider Program for Business. Microsoft recommends that all enterprise devices register with a work account in Azure Active Directory (AAD), either individually or as part of a domain registration. A domain registration will make it easier for the ITPro to administer everything. It is required to submit feedback on behalf of your organization, and for you as administrator to manage Insider Preview builds on other devices in your domain. Additionally, you can track feedback provided through the Feedback Hub App across your organization.

For enterprise users, you get to use early builds of the enterprise edition and provide feedback to Microsoft before the public release is finalized. 

## Register!
You register with either your Microsoft account (MSA) or your Azure Active Directory (AAD) account. If you want to register using a Microsoft account and don't have one yet, see [create account](https://signup.live.com/). If you don't have an AAD account, find out how to out how to get an [Azure Active Directory tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).
